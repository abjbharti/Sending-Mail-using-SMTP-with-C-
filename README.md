# Sending-Mail-using-SMTP-with-C#
This is a project i.e. created on C# language.
In this project user can perform CRUD operation. With CRUD operation, it means that user can create, read, update and delete the information.
This project is mage only on C# language.
In this project, user can also send email using his personal email which will be mentioned on the code.
I use SMTP for sending the mail.
User can also broadcast the mail, it means that user can send multiple mail at a time with this.
You will need to change several plaves like in Broadcasting and Sending.
There in each file, you have to change email id at 2 places and credential password at one place.
You would have to use your credential password for sending the mail.
To know how to generate credential passwords, you can contact me on my linkedin profile i.e., https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhijeet-bharti-66b015194/
